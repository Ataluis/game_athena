# Athena

In this simple game you move a spaceship with the arrow keys. Try not to get hit by the laser bubbles and survive as long as possible.

To run:

Execute the run.sh file from your console with:

> ./run.sh

The program will ask you for root permission and install the SFML libraries (in case they are not already installed).
